        <h4>A great American tradition.</h4>
        <p>One of the great American traditions in this country, Thanksgiving has often been a means to serve the most marginalized in society. From volunteering at soup kitchens to inviting our neighbors into our homes, the altruistic spirit of this quintessentially American holiday is all around us this time of the year.</p>
